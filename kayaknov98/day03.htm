    <p><strong>Notes<br>
    </strong>As I was approaching Everett, things got exciting. A largish dark gray boat was
    moving real slow across my bow from right to left. Didn't think much of it, so I paddled
    for a few more minutes. Then I saw an identical boat off to starboard, well camouflaged
    against the background of the city. My course would take me between them. I paddled on,
    but something nagged at me. I looked them over more carefully and then it hit me. These
    were naval tugboats. I looked behind me.
    Sure enough, a big Naval ship was on my six! Full left rudder! I paddled out into the bay
    at 90 degrees to my original course (see map), and then bobbed in the massive wake while
    watching the ship be guided to its moorage. Many sailors stood out on deck. Impressive
    ship. You know, I bet it was the same one that I saw earlier from Picnic point (Picture
    3). While I was plainly visible and there was no danger of collision, I would like to know
    if my foil ball on deck put me on their radar.</p>
    <p>No campground available today either. Had to make-do.</td>

<p><strong>Log Entry</strong><br>
Man, do my shoulders hurt. My back feels a little less sore. My knees didn't hurt today -
keeping them straight along the bottom of the kayak seems to be the key. Still trying to
figure out how to help my back while in the boat. Moved rudder pedals forward a notch, I
think that helps. The muscles at the base of my neck, between the shoulder blades ache
when used.</p>

<p>Today was another long day paddling. Edmonds to Everett. Made it to Jetty Island. I
have been lucky enough the first 3 days to have maximized travel time.</p>

<p>Lots to write about. Saw porpoise backs, eagles, and an owl today. Of course sea lions
and harbor seals. The hull is damaged in many places + paint has been sanded off. The
crack in the rear hull, visible in the aft hold does not appear to leak. The front is not
so good. Inside the fore hatch, two splintered, almost punctured, spots. Would like to try
to fix those with goop to make it water tight like the rear hold.</p>

<p>Good thing it hasn't been raining. Darn hard to keep things dry as is. I'm already
getting smelly. Would like to have a stopover day to bathe + do laundry. I'll need to
build a fire for drying laundry.</p>

<p>Speaking of drying, I dried out the VHF radio over the camp stove today. Seems to work
great again. Yes! Awesome! I took it apart + held the electronics pieces over the fire.
When everything was dry + working ok, I duct taped the radio bag's clip to avoid the same
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The kayak and my gear attract attention. At Edmonds, people came by for a
closer look. At Mukilteo, a fellow struck up a conversation and wanted to know all about
it.</p>

<p>So far I feel pretty comfortable and safe. We'll see how things are now that currents
matter. OK. Sleep time.</p>
