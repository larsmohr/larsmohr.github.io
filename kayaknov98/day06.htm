Whew. Another long day paddling. Stopping to pee wasn't such a big problem today. One
place I stopped was a huge sandy tidal area. When I got out of the boat, I sank up to my
knees in the sand. It was like quicksand. I leaned on the kayak to keep myself afloat in
the sand. The drysuit does bunch in my right armpit though. Feels like my hairs are being
pulled out with each stroke - that is pretty annoying.</p>

<p>Today was a great sunny day though. I've been really lucky with the wind too - at my
back, pushing me all the way. Saw an eagle feeding on a rock. Lots and lots of ducks,
loons, herons. Lots of fishing boats tending whatever it is they mark with floats. Crab
pots, I guess.</p>

<p>I think today might have been the largest single-day distance yet. My shoulders did ok.
I think I woke with sharp pains in my shoulder last night - kinda like wrist RSI. My hands
and wrists are fine with the paddling. You know, if today was the longest distance, then
it's noticeable that I'm getting more endurance, more efficiency, and am more comfortable
sitting in the boat for long distances.</p>

<p>On Hope Island, I had some daylight to work with. I setup a clothes line and hung some
stuff to dry. Little help though. Everything is wet, including sleeping pad and bag.
Still, I'm plenty warm. Finally dried the stove by cooking dinner, but it burns a yellow
flame now, not blue. I've been listening to a local radio station while doing chores. I
fixed some of the stitches on the vest [I made a vest the day before I left using material
from a 8$ sleeping bag from the Salvation Army]. I haven't attended to much in the way of
hygiene for 6 days now. Teeth and hands yeah. I guess so far so good because kayaking is a cleaner, less sweaty sport compared
to hiking. Ok, well, I'm pretty sleepy and still need to plan Deception Pass. I've slipped
fairly easily into the 9pm sleep, 5am wake schedule to maximize daylight travel.</p>
