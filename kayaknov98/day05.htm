<p><strong>Log Entry</strong><br>
Paddle to Camano Island. Got up early + called Sylvia. Although I had warned her I may not
always find a phone, she'd been really worried after talking with friends and not having
heard from me yesterday. She wanted me to come home right away. I brought her up to date
and things settled down. Visited a harbor on Hat Island for a pee break on my way to
Camano. Saw lots of loons and a Coast Guard ship. Camano park is really poor for kayaks.
The nearest campsite is down a road and up a hill and a long way from the water. There is
a phone at the park entrance, but that's really far away. Would have liked to talk to
Sylvia. Tomorrow will be a big push for Hope Island w/o favorable currents. Hope the wind
is at my back.</p>

<p>I made a huge effort and was able to get to the park's phone. It was high tide, so I
had to make my way through the obstacle course of logs, then up along the road in the
pitch black. I jogged right past the phone and continued on for another 1/3 mile before
deciding something was wrong and headed back. Sure enough, there was the phone in the
middle of nowhere along the roadside. No lights. So, I stood there in the darkness and
called Sylvia. We had it out.We almost arranged for her to pick me up, but I didn't feel
right about it yet, and she's been trying to get me back home since day 1. It needs to be
me who calls the end. So far things are going according to plans and I'm &nbsp;
comfortable. Near the end of our conversation, it started to pour and I got pretty wet
standing there in the woods holding the phone. Water running down my sleeve.</p>
