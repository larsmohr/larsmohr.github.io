<p><strong>Day 9, Monday, November 9, 1998<br>
</strong>Sucia I., WA, to Portland I, B.C.<br>
23.25 miles.</p>

<p><strong>Notes<br>
</strong>Well, I think I will be more relaxed the next time I cross shipping lanes.
Careful, yes, but there's a lot of water out there. I was amazed that ship fit between me
and Saturna Island.</p>

<p><strong>Log Entry</strong><br>
Yup, another full day of paddling. Thought I'd take the day off, but once I started, I
just kept going. I started around 9a, an hour later than usual, and made my way to Patos
Island in the rain. On Patos was a sailor walking his dog. After a quick stop I was cold,
and the tides were right, so I started off across the channel for Saturna Island, BC. As I
made my way across, I saw what looked like an island with trees off to starboard. After
paddling some more, I looked again and discovered it was a ship heading my way. Not that I
would have done anything different, but I had forgot that this was a shipping channel. At
first the ship was aiming behind me, so I paddled. Then it was aiming right at me, so I
paddled hard and it was aiming behind me again. Getting closer now, it turned and aimed at
me again. I paddled for all I was worth, thinking I could make it to the Saturna shore and
it would go behind me. It turned even more and was aiming ahead of me. I stopped paddling.
She ship was very close and I worried that it might turn back towards me. With only a few
minutes before the ship would be upon me, I reached behind my back, pulled out the VHF
radio, turned it on, pressed the transmit button, and with all 5 watts said,
&quot;Southbound freighter approaching Saturna Island, this is kayaker in the water, do
you see me off your port bow ok?&quot;.</p>

<p>I paused a few seconds, then dropped the radio to stay ready with the paddle. After a
moment, I heard a woman's voice, but the radio's volume was set too low. As I put the
radio to my ear, she completed her transmission, of which all I heard was a couple
numbers, and then there was silence, and the ship was upon me. I don't know if that was a
reply, or if they even heard me. We missed each other though. I made the Saturna Island
shore and was greeted by a house flying a Canadian flag. I would have liked to have known
if the ship's crew saw me. I might even have been on their radar because of the foil ball
on the back deck.</p>

<p>Coming across, my back had really been hurting - sore lower back muscles. I had to keep
paddling, so I just decided to ignore the pain. Then the ship had me going full steam
ahead and I didn't feel a thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, once I got to Saturna, the current had drifted me South, so I didn't bother
with Tumbo Island or Cabbage Island. I just turned SW and headed for Swartz Bay. I had
decided to head there and find a ferry or other way to go to Comox and Visit Renee. Too
much paddling to go up there. Plus, Sylvia was waiting, and the weather was forecast rough
enough to keep me on shore for a couple days (small craft advisory to gale force winds).
As it turned out, it was a great run to Swartz Bay - the tide current was going my way,
and the wind was at my back. I made great time.</p>

<p>Yeah, the ride from Saturna, past South Pender and Moresby was great. It is really
great for moral to see so much progress so quickly - as opposed to the Sucia approach.
There sure were some turbulent bits though. The whole stretch from Saturna to Pender was
ripped. In front of Pender it was pretty confused too. Once I hit Point Fairfax on
Moresby, everything fell quiet - currents and wind. I fussed with the maps some while
floating in front of Pt. Fairfax. My Puget Sound overview map mislabeled the Princess
Margaret park island, and my nautical charts don't mention the park, so I was left trying
to remember what the Gulf Islands book said (which was in the drybag in the hold). Light
was quickly fading, so I had to chose an island and commit. Luckily, I chose
&quot;wisely&quot; and was setting up the tent as it got dark. This was the latest I've
set up camp. Oh yeah, there were 3 big eagles sitting side by side in a treetop at Pt.
Fairfax. That was nice to see.</p>

<p>This is also the longest that I've gone without calling Sylvia. I would have liked to,
but there was no question of paddling to Swartz Bay. I'll plan to call her tomorrow
morning when I've arranged travel to see Renee.</p>

<p>So, it looks like that wraps up my big solo kayaking trip during this vacation. I think
it was a really good trip. Well planned and executed. I'm proud of it and look forward to
reflecting on it. I'm looking forward to running some calculations on average cruising
speed too. The pictures should be fun. I'll try to scan in the best ones and then put
together a web page scrapbook of the trip.</p>

<p>Being so close to Swartz Bay, the big BC Ferry boats are rumbling by. I wish I had a
tape recorder with. Then I could share some of the sounds. A video camera would have been
cool also. There would have been some great footage.</p>

<p>I won't miss being damp all the time, but I'm going to miss kayaking. It's been a great
trip. A trip of discovery. I've had a chance to visit those places I've seen on maps and
thought about so much. Patos, Sucia, Matia, and Clark islands I was particularly looking
forward to. They were so mysterious and far off. It was great. I really put on the miles
too. I wonder what the total for her maiden voyage will be? Well, my eyes are dry and
sleepy, so I'm going to listen to the radio or tapes a little more, then sleep.</p>
