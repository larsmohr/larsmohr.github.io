Relaxed on Jetty Island. I was worried about my shoulder pain, so I took a day off. It
wasn't enough for a full recovery - much how my blisters would not heal in one day. I hope
to be comfortable tomorrow. Today would have been excellent - the wind would have been at
my back for the trip to Camano. Hopefully tomorrow too.</p>

<p>I spent today relaxing. I ate well, listened to my Charles Lindbergh book on tape,
explored the island, dried things, repaired some damage to the hull, glued in the heel pad
on the floor, played with the map and compass. It really started pouring in the afternoon
and things got damp again.</p>

<p>I wish I could have called Sylvia today, and kept up the daily afternoon calls, but
it's about 1hr each way to the phone. I'd like to rest my shoulders. Possibly I can get to
the phone in the morning. I'll call Sylvia and then head for Camano.</p>
