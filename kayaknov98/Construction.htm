    </strong>Plans from <a href="http://www.clcboats.com" TARGET="NEW">Chesapeake Light Craft</a>.<br>
    May 1998 to October 1998.<br>
    127+ hours.<br>
    Spread over about 35 days.<br>
    During 5 months.<p><strong>Pictures Shown<br>
    </strong>1. Stitching the hull panels together with copper wire.<br>
    2. Hull with fiberglass exterior complete.<br>
    3. Sylvia taking the hull for a spin.<br>
    4. Installing the deck plywood and cockpit coaming.<br>
    5. Making an end pour. The boat's two stories high!<br>
    6. Painting inside and out.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Notes<br>
    </strong>This kayak is made from 8x4 plywood sheets and then stitched and glued together.
    While there are lots of positives to building this kayak, but I don't think I'll build
    another boat. It takes a lot of time - time I could have spent paddling if I just bought a
    used boat. I feel that money possibly saved has been overshadowed by lost wages also. What
    I mean is, if I had bought a boat and used the kayak-building time to study and learn to
    advance my career, I could be way ahead. </p>
    <p>On the pro-build side, working in the shop was enjoyable. It is satisfying to have
    built my own boat (one of those life achievements). I now have the experience of building
    something from plans, working with fiberglass and resins, and have learned new tips and
    tricks and skills. Overall, it was rewarding and I'm happy to have built the kayak.</td>
