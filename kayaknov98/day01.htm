    <p><strong>Notes<br>
    </strong>Sylvia helped me roll the boat and carry the gear down the trail behind the house
    to the Sammamish River (picture #2). At the river, the bank was steep enough that we used
    the tow line to belay the kayak down to the water. At 9:15am I was underway with a heavy
    load - low in the water, but very stable. Just minutes after launch is a shallow rapids,
    and I hit a rock that, days later, would be discovered to have caused through-hull damage
    and a leak! The forward hold was leaking at a rate of about a cup every 6 hours.</p>
    <p>Being Sunday, I met a group of three kayakers near St. Edwards State Park. At the UW
    docks, I called Sylvia. She wanted to come pick me up already! I had to make-do for a spot
    to sleep.</p>
    <p><strong>Log Entry</strong><br>
    Long day paddling. It was a luxury to listen to KPLU using the walkman in the evening. I'm
    feeling real sore now, after eating dinner. Neck, shoulders. My right hand's finger's
    tingle a little.</td>
