Guess what? Another grueling day of paddling! I started off from Strawberry Island and was
swept along by the currents to Lawrence Point, Orcas Island. From there I made my way to
the Clark Island area, and stopped briefly. The wind was blowing and it was cold. I put on
my hat, but got going after eating quickly. </p>

<p>The next leg to Sucia Island sucked. I had my first real opposing current and the wind
was against me too. Eventually, I gave in, and took a break on Matia Island. That was a
good idea, and I made Sucia easily afterward. Sucia is super amazing gorgeous. Out here in
the huge Straight of Georgia, in Echo bay it was millpond smooth and sunny. Just a super
nice place. Surreal. Apparently overrun with boaters in the summer. Bumped into one fellow
coming ashore from his brand new motor yacht as I was landing. He invited me to join them
for a campfire later. After doing my chores, I did just that. It was delightful. A nice
warm fire. I roasted my wieners and we all shared my stash of marshmallows. It was nice to
talk with them. The stars are incredible out here. </p>

<p>This couple, with their little daughter, were from the San Diego area and are big
divers and skiers. They came up for vacation and took his parent's new yacht out for a
shakedown cruise. Impressive boat. It is very modern, had stabilizer fins and all sorts of
gear. They recounted some real bad weather they encountered crossing the Straight of Juan
de Fuca. Broke a lot of dishes apparently.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I was thinking of taking it easy, maybe camp on Patos. Problem is, it is
supposed to be calm tomorrow, then become &quot;small craft advisory&quot; conditions next
couple days. I should push through to Vancouver Island, but my hands hurt and it sure is
nice here.</p>
