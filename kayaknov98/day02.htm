    <p><strong>Notes<br>
    </strong>At the locks I waited at the holding pier for the small locks. I worried about
    how I'd know what to do. Eventually, the upstream doors opened and a parade of yachts
    motored past me. They were going slow enough, so most asked where was I was going and
    offered encouragement. One woman, on hearing I'd try for Vancouver Island, shouted
    &quot;eat a lot!&quot;.</p>
    <p>When the last boat passed, I heard something over the loudspeaker, but couldn't make it
    out. I paddled forward into the channel to get closer. Then I heard &quot;kayaker, clear
    the channel, I'd like to get the fishing boat in first&quot;. I couldn't hear a boat, and
    it is pretty difficult to look behind me, so I was surprised that there was a boat. I
    backed up and it passed me on the left. The fishermen also asked me what I was up to. </p>
    <p>I paused then moved slowly forward. When I passed into the lock's chamber, the
    attendant said &quot;You need to be aware of what's happening behind you.&quot;. To my
    surprise, just then another fishing boat came by on my left. I'll need to get a rearview
    mirror like a sculler or biker users.</p>
    <p>Still no designated camp site tonight. Had to do what I could. I won't be at a
    campground until Day 5.</td>

I skipped the oatmeal breakfast and made an effort to get started quickly. I started
paddling around 7:30am. Went through the Montlake Cut and stopped for water at Gasworks
Park. Next was the fishing/industrial area that ended with the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks.
My Marine VHF radio's Ewa WaterSound bag lost its clip when I pulled it out and water got
#@&amp;% into the radio! After the locks, I paddled to Golden Garden's park and took the
radio apart to dry it. Lost a @#$%&amp; screw while I was at it. Good thing was, when I
put is back together again, it partly worked. Worst case, a $130 lesson. I even doubted
that damn clip back home. Should have acted on that feeling and taped it in position.</p>

<p>On leaving Golden Garden Park at 1:15p, I did a long stretch across a bay to Pt. Wells
and then finally beached at Edmonds 3hrs later. Felt pretty good after having adjusted the
seat! I stuffed a pair of pants behind the backrest. I called Sylvia and left a message.
Then I was off to find a spot to spend the night. It will be nice when I can have a
regular camp site! Soon. We're getting to the good stuff.</p>

<p>This is really beautiful. Calm water, stars are out, ferries are milling about on the
water. Full moon tonight. Time to pour over the maps and do my other chores.</p>
