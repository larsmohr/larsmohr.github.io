<p><strong>Notes<br>
</strong>It was Tuesday, November 10 when I landed on Vancouver Island. On Wednesday I
visited the Royal British Columbia Museum and made my way up to see Renee. The next day,
Thursday, I visited with Renee. Apparently that's when the small craft advisory/gale
conditions came in. It was a rainy day and pretty goof surf was crashing in at Renee's
place. When I drove back to Sidney to take the ferry, there was lots of wind and gusts
along the coast. I listened to the marine VHF radio and they were talking about 50mph
winds. </p>

<p>On Friday, I made my way through U.S. Customs and rolled the kayak onto the Anacortes
ferry. I met a lot of people on the ferry ride. A lot of people showed interest in my
trip. For the first hour, I was having fun up on the deck at the bow, in the wind and
rain. I was testing my clothes and I also had my charts with me. I was identifying islands
and enjoying the scenery since we were travelling through the middle of the San Juans.
After a while it was socked in and I couldn't see much any more, so I got out of the wind
and chatted with people. I don't think I would have met nearly so many people travelling
as a couple.</p>

<p>After a 3hr ferry trip, I arrived in Anacortes at 3pm. In talking to one of the ferry
workers, he said the weather in the sound was indeed nasty yesterday afternoon and
evening. He said there were huge waves and one of the big glass windows in the ferry was
blown in. Boy, I would have liked to have taken a ferry ride in that! I'm comfortable with
my decision to come in at Sidney rather than push on with the 5-7 day trip north to Comox
and then Miracle Beach.</p>

<p>Almost 5 hours after arriving in Anacortes, Sylvia arrived to pick me up. Then, after a
2 hour drive, I was home again. It was a 13 day trip in total.</p>

<em>Day 11, Wednesday, November 11, 1998</em><br>
So I got to the museum at 7:15a. I bought about 4hrs parking in the empty lot, then sat
near the museum doors reading <em>Cold Oceans</em> until the doors opened at 8:50a. I sure
was the best prepared for standing in the line in the cold. The exhibition was fun. They
had made working models of many of this sketches. They had lots of reproductions of his
paintings and notes. Outside on the streets of the capitol, in front of the parliament
buildings, were Remembrance Day crowds and officials laying wreaths. </p>

<p>Afterwards, I picked up my film and headed North to see Renee. About 4 hours later I
arrived and we went out to dinner that night. I called Sylvia from Renee's and she said
she had a bad day at work.<br>
<br>
<em>Day 12, Thursday, November 12, 1998<br>
</em>I finished my 1st breakfast bag this morning. I bet I did have 20 days of food. Renee
and I went for a walk through the woods, along Black Creek, and along the beach. We spend
the rest of the day, which was very rainy, at her place looking at her driftwood art,
books, and chatting. It was a real treat to see her again. </p>

<p>Around 3pm I left for Victoria. After looking into the ferries, it looks like the 12
noon Anacortes ferry is the best for me. Another option was to take the fast Victoria
Clipper catamaran straight to downtown Seattle. That was expensive and the kayak, if even
accepted, would be pricey too. The third option was a ferry to Port Angeles, but that
leaves from Victoria and Port Angeles is farther for Sylvia to drive than Anacortes. I am
very lucky in that the Anacortes ferry terminal is only a few blocks away from the Budget
rental office, and the trip is only $10. Budget opens at 8am, so I'll try to have the van
returned, fully fueled, and have the kayak off + reloaded by 8am.&nbsp; Fantastic. Ok, I
need to top off fuel, have dinner, and prepare for packing the kayak again.</p>
