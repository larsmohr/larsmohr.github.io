<em><strong>Figure 1: In the backyard with the entire set of gear on the deck or in front
of the kayak.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>
Preparing for the trip is a big part of the fun! I was particularly happy with the plan to
wear the drysuit and a cargo vest loaded with gear that would keep me safe and warm - and
rescued - should I be separated from my kayak. Below is the packing list copied from my
PalmPilot. I rave about that little computer. I believe it helped me be more efficient in
the construction of the kayak and particularly helpful with the preparations for the trip
- not to mention the everyday benefits. We highly recommended the little device!</p>

<p>There was also a lot of reading involved in the preparation. We borrowed books and
videos from the library. Derek C. Hutchinson's were enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed
reading Sea Kayaker Magazine's <em>Deep Trouble</em>. That book is filled with kayaking
disaster stories, many in the waters I'd be paddling, and kept me busy taking notes of
things to do. It was particularly helpful in ensuring that I didn't question the need to
wear a drysuit and having a marine VHF radio. <em>Deep Trouble</em> also led me to have
everything tied on: paddles, chart cases, seat cushion, and even the hatch covers were
tied to the inside of the boat with a length of cord. Fun reading.<br>
<br>
For hands-on practice, I would take the kayak down the the lake. I practiced the basics
and then focused on the Eskimo roll. A couple months earlier I had attended the West Coast
Kayak Symposium and took part in the Eskimo rolling class there. At the time, I had only
outfitted the cockpit with foam on the floor to sit on - no hip blocks, knee braces, or
foot braces - so I didn't manage an Eskimo roll until those were installed a week before
launch.</p>

<p><strong>Cost Breakdown</strong><br>
Even though we have a bunch of camping gear, gearing up for kayaking, refreshing our
camping gear, and preparing for a possible 20 day trip sure added up. This is exaggerated
to some extent - I have put the full price of the drysuit here, but that's unfair since
it's cost will be spread over many scuba diving trips. Much of the gear here will last a
long time and be enjoyed over many trips in the future. However, the total does fairly
accurately reflect expenditures while ramping up for, and during the trip. The total does
not include the $500 to build the kayak.</p>

<strong>Tips:</strong><br>

*waterproof headlamp is nice, but what really matters is duration.<br>
*double or triple bag water-damageable items<br>
*everything should float: radio, etc<br>
*tie everything on<br>
*Warning: don't mess around- bring proper gear to stay warm. (Warm even if wet too -
wetsuit/drysuit)<br>
*spray skirt -be able to remove one-handed<br>
*leave a float plan<br>
*tie paddle + pump to boat<br>
*items on deck catch wind + make tracking difficult - rudder fixes that<br>
