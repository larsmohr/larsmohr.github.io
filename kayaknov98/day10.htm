<p><strong>Log Entry</strong><br>
I got up at 7am and departed Princess Margaret Park (Portland Island) at 9am. I made my
way across to Coal Island so as to leave as much maneuvering room as I could when crossing
the ferry channel. I poked around the Swartz Bay ferry area, but there was no ferry
information and no phone. There were some floating junk boats there [picture 2].</p>

<p>I then made my way around to the Van Isles marina that the Gulf Islands book said had
showers and laundry. Along the way, saw an otter and some American Black Oystercatchers -
plump black birds with pencil-like bright orange/red beaks. A bunch of things were on my
mind. I needed to check in with customs, I needed to find out about ferries to Comox, call
Renee, and call Sylvia.</p>

<p>At the marina, at the end of the first dock, is a phone to call Canada customs. That
was fun. They were friendly and it went something like this:</p>

<p>Customs: &quot;Do you have a registration number or serial number for your
vessel?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;No, it's homemade&quot;<br>
Customs: &quot;When was the boat built?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Last week&quot;<br>
Customs: &quot;What color is your boat?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Um, blue and red deck with a beige hull&quot;<br>
Customs: &quot;17ft you say?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Yup.&quot;<br>
Customs: &quot;Are you [the only one in the party]?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>There were some other questions and then I was given a clearance number. On to the
marine office, I met Jerry. He told me the ferries do not go to Comox. At that point I
fell back to the car rental plan. I bumped into Jerry again in the very nice and clean,
newly renovated bathroom. He said there was a budget rental in town, about 2 miles away.
he described it as a long walk, then offered that I come with him into town - he was going
in a couple minutes. I didn't accept at first, but walked back to my kayak which was
floating, moored alongside dock &quot;D&quot;. I broke down the paddle, put on the cockpit
cover and took my fanny pack and survival vest and went to find Jerry. Renting a car was
the best thing to do.</p>

<p>As we drove into town, I discovered that Jerry lives at the marina in a 40ft motor
yacht and has lived on boats for 30yrs. He runs a business repairing boats and salvaging
sunken boats. He says a friend monitors Channel 16 and calls Jerry in when he needs a
diver to bring up a sunken boat. Boy, that would be fun. He said most commonly, someone
runs into rocks and sinks in fairly shallow water.</p>

<p>He dropped me off at Budget and waited a moment to be sure I got a car. I was still
wearing my drysuit, sporting a beard, and had some seriously messed up hair. They had two
compact cars and a minivan. The Tercel was about $35 and the minivan about $70. The
minivan had a roof rack though - and that would make my life easier. I hummed and hawed,
and while I did, the Budget dealer really shined. It was the off season and they had a
promotion that had the minivan $30 off at $70. Since they didn't have a full size car, he
was able to upgrade me to the minivan and it would only be $39 a day. A great price
considering the luxury and convenience it provides me - not to mention a comfortable place
to sleep! It's also Canadian $, so that helps too.</p>

<p>I rented the van and drove back to the marina. Immediately, I put the wheels on the
kayak and towed it up on the shore beside the van. About 45 minutes later, the gear was
spread about and the kayak was sitting pretty on the roof rack. Next I went into town and
called Renee to work out a schedule. The next day I would try to meet up with her. She
also recommended the Leonardo DaVinci exhibit.</p>

<p>After calling Renee, it was back to the marina where I used the coin-op shower and
laundry and shaved. I also left the van running with full heat and used its many vents to
dry things. Next I headed down to Victoria to look into the Leonardo thing. I found the
museum by the waterfront, and then moved on to have my film developed. This I did at
Wal-Mart, with some film to be picked up the next day.</p>

<p>Then it was time to sleep. I drove around quite a bit before finding a great little
pull out next to a nice waterside park, across from a row of houses. I slept very well on
the rear-most bench seat under my sleeping bag. And what fun to wake at 5:30a and find
frost on the car! Going outside to pee, the air was cool enough that I felt it on my legs.
The vest I made from a sleeping bag really keeps me warm though.</p>

<p>Ok, enough writing. It is Wednesday morning. I'm sitting sideways in the driver's seat
with the sleeping bag on my lap. The reading light is on so I can write. This is so much
fun! It's like an RV! How cozy. I need to get dressed warm for standing in line, have
breakfast, and then get to the museum!</p>
