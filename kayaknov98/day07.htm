Wow! I'm actually sitting at a picnic table writing! I'm on Strawberry Island and this is
just awesome - the best campsite yet. This table is varnished! That's part of why it is
dry. When I setup camp - a gorgeous spot overlooking the water - I had the tables covered
with gear to dry. The wind was blowing and things dried well. My foam sleeping pad gets
really nasty - smelly - when wet. I have the island to myself. I'd like to see some other
kayaks.</p>

<p>This morning I slept in some because my progress depended on slack current (11:30a) in
Deception Pass. I hung out in Cornet Bay until 10:45a, then shot through, riding the last
of the outgoing tide. I paddled right by a salad bowl-sized whirlpool - I could have put
my hand in it! From then on it was a struggle north into a strong wind to Washington Park.
I toped off water and gave Sylvia and call. Much better this time. </p>

<p>I rushed out of there because I wanted to camp on Strawberry Island. I'm glad I did,
but it was a brutal paddle into a stiff wind. When I got here I checked the radio, and
there was a small craft advisory! Well, I probably saw occasional 3 ft waves, lots of 2ft
waves, and mostly 1ft waves. The wind gusts were sustained and grabbed at my paddle. Even
though, I had no trouble, was not unstable at all. I had fun in the waves actually. Strong
headwind sucks though.</p>

<p>Well, I've got to stop writing soon because I'm starving! This island is super
gorgeous. It reminds me of a Myst island actually. I took a bunch of pictures on arrival.
Very happy I made the effort to come here instead of camping at Washington Park.</p>

<p>Today was a second nice, sunny day. Just as dark was settling in, a massive ship with
two escort ships throbbed by. Impressive. Well, that was a hard paddling day. The forecast
is for clear tomorrow, with the wind at my back again. I hope so, I'd love to make it to
Sucia or Patos tomorrow. Ok, I'm gonna eat!</p>
