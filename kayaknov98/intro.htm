    the construction of&nbsp; a 17 foot kayak and her maiden voyage. After 127+ hours of work
    over 5 months, she was ready.</p>
    <p>When my vacation started in late October, I spent the next 7 days completing the kayak,
    gearing up for her maiden voyage, training, and reading. Although we've done lots of
    hiking and canoeing, this is the first kayak camping trip for me.</p>
    <p>Because I was heading out alone, and in winter, I was making careful safety
    preparations. In addition to flares and the other standard safety items, I was planning to
    paddle in my scuba diving drysuit, and I would be carrying a marine VHF radio.</p>
    <p>The day after the kayak was ready, November 1st, I launched into the cool November air
    on a 200 mile journey to Vancouver Island with 20 days of food. I wore a big smile...</p>
